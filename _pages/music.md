I play a variety of instruments, none of them particularly well. I also write music. 

Here's a list of music projects I can recall being involved with, in rough chronological order:
- Luin
- Chris & Eric (& sometimes Jeremy)
- The Luxury Tax
- [Budget Cuts Music](http://budgetcutsmusic.com)
- The Germans
- Can't Complain
- Burbank International
- [Jackson Arms](https://soundcloud.com/jacksonarms)
- What Model Citizens
- [The Company](https://soundcloud.com/thecompanysoundsystem)
