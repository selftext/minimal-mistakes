As of Saturday, May 28, 2016, there were only seven results on Google for the query [*”mime admirer”*](https://www.google.com/#q=%22mime%20admirer%22).

Of those, six were the product of incorrect OCR, often an endearingly mistaken reading of the French words *même admirer*.

The only true mime admirer comes from [ZenaStar on DeviantArt](https://zenastar.deviantart.com/art/i-only-draw-couples-these-days-364446687). And now this blog post, fragments we have shored against our ruins.
