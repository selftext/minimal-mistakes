In August I left Spotify. It was fascinating to see how sophisticated machine learning is done at such a large scale, and I learned a great deal about the music industry. Ultimately, though, it wasn't a good fit. I've realized I'm much happier at a smaller organization where I can build things from the ground up.

I'm now at [Sawyer](https://www.sawyertools.com/company), a platform for children's educational activities. At this point, I have experience at a variety of tech companies, and I've seen what works and what doesn't, particularly for data teams. With this in mind, I wrote a post on Locally Optimistic with advice for the first data hires at early stage startups: [Building a Data Practice from Scratch](https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/building-a-data-practice/). I hope someone finds it helpful.
