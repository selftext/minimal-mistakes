I’ve given a few talks this year. Two were focused on data work at Kickstarter, and one was a presentation of a paper by Eytan Bakshy and Dean Eckles on bootstrap methods for experiment analysis.

Although I tend to be shy in small groups, I enjoy public speaking. Maybe it’s because presentations are a form of performance, and I’ve always loved playing music for people. Unlike small group settings, presentations are something I can prepare and practice for, and they’re akin to teaching.

I’ve uploaded slides from my last three talks to a new [Github repo](https://github.com/selftext/talks), and I added a [Talks](/talks/) section to this site.
