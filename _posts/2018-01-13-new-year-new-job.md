Life is change. I've found a new job. These are interrelated.

Later this month I'm starting at Spotify as a Product Insights Manager, working with data scientists and user researchers to understand how users engage with recommendations, personalization, and search. I'm pumped.

During my last few years at Kickstarter, I learned how to be a manager by first diving into the deep end and then taking the time to reflect on my experience. The challenge now is to apply the knowledge I've gained to a new role, to discover what translates directly, what needs to be adapted, and what I still need to learn.

In preparation, I've read two books: Camille Fournier's *The Manager's Path* and Michael D. Watkins's *The First 90 Days.* These books have helped to structure my thinking about my transition, to assess my strengths and weaknesses, to anticipate what challenges I may face, and to plan for how I can drive impact as quickly as possible.

In particular, I like Camille Fournier's mantra: "Stay curious." In other words, ask questions, and be open to new perspectives and experiences. This is as true in management as it is in all aspects of life. My purpose now, as it has always been, is to keep learning while accepting that life will continue to change.
