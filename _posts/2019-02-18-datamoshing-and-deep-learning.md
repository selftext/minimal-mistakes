I've started playing around with video art.

In particular, I'm exploring how to make destructive effects with [datamoshing](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/datamoshing) and how to generate [style transfers with deep learning](https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style). The results are unpredictable and weird. It's fun.

I've made a [video art repo](https://github.com/selftext/video-art) to track my work. It has links to resources I've found helpful and code for manipulating video and running command-line scripts.
