A few months ago, [I wrote about the importance of rigorous thinking in the work I do]({{ site.baseurl }}/learning-to-lead/). Continual learning plays a key role to support that.

One way we’ve approached continual learning at Kickstarter is through small study groups. As an exercise in pair learning, my colleague Jeffrey Doker and I recently finished working through Hadley Wickham’s [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/). We enjoyed the experience so much [we wrote about it on the Kickstarter engineering blog](https://kickstarter.engineering/always-be-learning-f4a496dc3085).

I think our takeaways are useful for anyone who wants to incorporate continual learning into their work culture. If you try it, I'd love to hear about your experience.
