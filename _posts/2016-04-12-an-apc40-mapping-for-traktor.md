Here’s the custom APC40 Traktor mapping I use when DJing with [The Company Soundsystem](https://soundcloud.com/thecompanysoundsystem). I made a little graphic to show how everything is laid out. The blue italics mean the shift button should be held down in combination with the control.

The basic layout is 4 decks and 4 FX units. It’s hard to show all the interactions (especially with the shift button) on this graphic, so I’m happy to explain more in detail.

I don’t know how many people have the original APC40 now that the MKII has come out. I don’t know how many people are even interested in custom Traktor mappings now that so many dedicated controllers are available.

But if you are one of those people, this mapping is a blast. Have fun with it, and let me know if you find it useful.
